One of her books that left an indelible mark is 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'. This iconic tale, published in 1997, tells the story of Harry, a young orphan who discovers his magical abilities on his 11th birthday. Soon, he finds himself at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a place teeming with magic and adventure, located somewhere in Scotland.\nb) The magic of Middle-earth has entranced readers worldwide, thanks to the brilliance of J.R.R. Tolkien. In one of his seminal works, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring', published in 1954, we meet Frodo Baggins, a brave hobbit tasked with the perilous quest of destroying the One Ring. The epic journey takes him from the peaceful Shire to the tumultuous regions of Middle-earth.\nc) In a galaxy far, far away, the imagination of L.E. Starlighter gives us 'The Prism Galaxy Chronicles: The Awakening of the Starcaster'. Published in 2028, the story is about Zylo, a humble spaceship mechanic, who unexpectedly discovers he's a Starcaster - a rare individual with the power to manipulate stardust.
