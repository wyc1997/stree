It is the process by which plants convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates, which are used to produce energy and build new cells. The two main stages of photosynthesis are the light-dependent stage and the light-independent stage.\nThe light-dependent stage occurs in the chloroplast, where chlorophyll molecules absorb light energy and use it to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is released into the chloroplast stroma, while the hydrogen is released into the chloroplast cytosol. The hydrogen is then used to produce ATP, which is used to power the cell.\nThe light-independent stage occurs in the chloroplast stroma, where ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) uses carbon dioxide and water to produce 3-phosphoglycerate, which is then used to produce glucose 6-phosphate. The glucose 6-phosphate is then used to produce sucrose, which is then used to produce starch and cellulose.\nThe light-independent stage is the main stage of photosynthesis, and it is the stage that is most affected by the environment.
